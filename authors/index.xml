      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, welcome to my page!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Daniel Jacobs and I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Houston.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My research interests include Household Finance and Macroeconomics. I am particularly interested in how individuals decide to acquire financial skills in order to manage their household finances. In my job market paper, I explore the effect of interest rate uncertainty on the decision to invest in financial literacy and evaluate policies that may support financial literacy acquistion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to research, I have had a wonderful experience teaching economics at the University of Houston. I have taught Principles of Macroeconomics, Principles of Microeconomics and Intermediate Macroeconomics at the undergraduate level. Due to the high student evaluations of my teaching effectiveness, I was awarded the department&amp;rsquo;s Graduate Student Teaching Award in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be attending the AEA meeting in San Diego between January 2nd-5th, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;/files/CV.pdf&#34;&gt;Download my CV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
